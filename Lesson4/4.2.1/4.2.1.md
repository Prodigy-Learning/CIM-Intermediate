# Intermediate Coding - Lesson 4.2.1 - Advanced Logic - Boolean Operators Activity

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
In this activity we will use boolean operators to enhance the functionality of if then blocks.

We will create a program which will use an IF THEN ELSE statement and some boolean operators to check what time time of day is in our game and let the player know if its morning, afternoon, evening or night time.

In this program we will create a variable to track the number of blocks placed which we will update when we lay or destroy a block of our chosen type. When this variable reaches a value which is divisible by 5 we will tell the player the total number of blocks currently placed.

In Minecraft the games runs a day night cycle which lasts 20 minutes in the real world. Time is measured in ticks in Minecraft with the day starting at 0 and the end of the day being 24000 ticks.

The below table shows some notable time points in the game with their equivalent Minecraft and Real World times which will be handy later.

## Step 2
From the ``||PLAYER:PLAYER||`` drawer drag out an ``||PLAYER:on chat command||`` event block and set it to respond to the command **time**
#### ~ tutorialhint
Open the PLAYER drawer and place a on chat command "jump" anywhere on the blue area
```blocks
player.onChat("time",function () {
 
})

```
## Step 3
From the ``||LOGIC:LOGIC||`` drawer drag out an ``||LOGIC:IF THEN ELSE||`` block and place it inside the ``||PLAYER:on chat command "time"||`` block.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("time", function () {
    if (true) {
    	
    } else {
    	
    }
})

```

## Step 4
Replace the default true block with a boolean ``||LOGIC:AND||`` block from the ``||LOGIC:LOGIC||`` drawer
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("time", function () {
    if (false && false) {
    	
    } else {
    	
    }
})


```

## Step 5
From the Logic drawer place a ``||LOGIC: 0 = 0 ||`` comparison block in the first part of the boolean and block and change its comparison operator to the greater than or equal to operator.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("time", function () {
    if (0 >= 0 && false) {
    	
    } else {
    	
    }
})
```

## Step 6
From the ``||GAMEPLAY:GAMEPLAY||`` drawer place a ``||GAMEPLAY:time query daytime||`` block in the first comparison block of the greater than or equal to comparison operator block.

The time query gametime block tells us the current game time in ticks.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("time", function () {
    if (gameplay.timeQuery(DAY_TIME) >= 0 && false) {
    	
    } else {
    	
    }
})
```
## Step 7
From the ``||LOGIC:LOGIC||`` drawer place a ``||LOGIC: 0 = 0 ||``comparison block in the second part of the boolean and block and change its comparison operator to the less than qual to operator.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("time", function () {
    if (gameplay.timeQuery(DAY_TIME) >= 0 && 0 <= 0) {
    	
    } else {
    	
    }
})
```

## Step 8
As before from the ``||GAMEPLAY:GAMEPLAY||`` drawer place a ``||GAMEPLAY:time query daytime||`` block in the first comparison block of the less than or equal to comparison operator block.

Change the numeric value in the second comparison block to 6000.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("time", function () {
    if (gameplay.timeQuery(DAY_TIME) >= 0 && gameplay.timeQuery(DAY_TIME) <= 6000) {
    	
    } else {
    	
    }
})
```

## Step 9
From the ``||PLAYER:PLAYER||`` drawer place a ``||PLAYER:say "hi"||`` block inside the IF block and change the text to "Its morning!".

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("time", function () {
    if (gameplay.timeQuery(DAY_TIME) >= 0 && gameplay.timeQuery(DAY_TIME) <= 6000) {
        player.say("Its morning!")
    } else {
    	
    }
})
```
## Step 10
Next lets test the code.

Click Next for instructions on how to test your code.

## Step 11 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.
![alt text](https://intermediate.codingcredentials.com/Lesson2/2.1.1/images/2.jpg?raw=true "Start")


2. When back in the game open the **chat window** by pressing the t key on the keyboard or tapping the chat icon and enter the word **time** and press enter

A message saying "Its morning" should appear
![alt text](https://intermediate.codingcredentials.com/Lesson4/4.2.1/images/2.jpg?raw=true "Test")


3. The game is currently set to be always day - in which case the ticks value is always 5000. 

We can determine the time of day by running the slash command **/time query daytime **
At the moment if we run the chat command time and the time of day is between 0 and 6000 ticks the message will appear.
![alt text](https://intermediate.codingcredentials.com/Lesson4/4.2.1/images/3.jpg?raw=true "Test")


4. Run the slash command **/alwaysday false** to enable the day/night cycle.
5. Change the current game time by running the slash command **/time set 13000**

You should notice it gets dark as at 13000 ticks is when night begins in the game
![alt text](https://intermediate.codingcredentials.com/Lesson4/4.2.1/images/4.jpg?raw=true "Test")


6. Run the time command in the chat window again and notice this time no message appears as both the conditions have not been met.

## Step 12
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.

## Step 13 @tutorialCompleted
Return to the game and move onto the activity.
