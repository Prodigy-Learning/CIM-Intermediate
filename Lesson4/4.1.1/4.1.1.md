# Intermediate Coding - 4.1.1 - Advanced Logic - IF THEN ELSE Activity

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
In this activity we will use ``||LOGIC:IF THEN ELSE||`` blocks to add some functionality to our Minecraft game.

In this program we use our agent to hunt for treasure!

## Step 2
From the ``||PLAYER:PLAYER||`` drawer drag out an ``||PLAYER:on player walk||`` event block.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
player.onTravelled(WALK, function () {
	
})
```
## Step 3
From the ``||AGENT:AGENT||`` drawer place an ``||AGENT:agent teleport to player||`` block inside the ``||PLAYER:on player walk||`` block.

This will move the Minecraft MakeCode Agent to your current position.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onTravelled(WALK, function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
})
```
## Step 4
Add an ``||LOGIC:IF THEN ELSE||`` block from the ``||LOGIC:LOGIC||`` drawer after the ``||AGENT:agent teleport to player||`` block
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onTravelled(WALK, function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    if (true) {
    	
    } else {
    	
    }
})
```

## Step 5
From the ``||LOGIC:LOGIC||`` drawer place an ``||LOGIC:0 = 0||`` comparison block on top of the true block in the ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` block to replace the true block.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onTravelled(WALK, function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    if (0 == 0) {
    	
    } else {
    	
    }
})
```

## Step 6
From the ``||AGENT:AGENT||`` drawer place an ``||AGENT:agent inspect block forward||`` block on top of the first 0 in the ``||LOGIC:0 = 0||`` comparison block and change it to inspect DOWN

Replace the 2nd 0 in the comparison block with a block block from the ``||BLOCKS:BLOCKS||`` drawer and leave it as the default grass block.

This will check if the block below the agent is a grass block and if so the blocks will run.

In this example the treasure is buried under a grass block therefore we will add a block to let the player know they've found the treasure when the agent is above a grass block.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onTravelled(WALK, function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    if (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block, DOWN) == GRASS) {
    	
    } else {
    	
    }
})
```

## Step 7
From the ``||PLAYER:PLAYER||`` drawer drag a ``||PLAYER:say "hi"||`` block and place it in the IF part of the block and replace the word Hi with You've found the treasure!

Place another ``||PLAYER:say "hi"||`` block in the else part of the statement and replace the word hi with Keep hunting!

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onTravelled(WALK, function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    if (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block, DOWN) == GRASS) {
        player.say("You've found the treasure!")
    } else {
        player.say("Keep hunting!")
    }
})
```

## Step 8
Next lets test the code.

Click Next for instructions on how to test your code.

## Step 9 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game and ensure you are on the ground and not flying

2. Walk around the 1st part of the island and you should get some chat messages appearing stating"Keep hunting!"
![alt text](https://intermediate.codingcredentials.com/Lesson4/4.1.1/images/1.jpg?raw=true "treasure")


3. Walk over to the x of grass blocks in the ground on the island. You should see some chat message appear stating "You've found the treasure!"

4. Dig the one block in the middle of the x of grass blocks to reveal a chest and open the chest by left clicking on it.

## Step 10
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.

## Step 11 @tutorialCompleted
Return to the game and move onto the next non player character.
