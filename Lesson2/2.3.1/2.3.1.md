# Intermediate Coding - Lesson 2.3.1 - Using Variables to count Activity - Performing Addition

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
In this activity we perform some mathematical calculations on a variable to count the number of grass blocks we lay and mine.

Firstly we will track the number we lay then we will look at how we can keep accurate count when we mine a grass block.

## Step 2
Create a Variable named **b** using the ``||VARIABLES:VARIABLES||`` drawer

## Step 3
Drag out an ``||BLOCKS:on block placed||`` block from the ``||BLOCKS:BLOCKS||`` drawer
Leave the block as the default ``||BLOCKS:Grass||`` block

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
blocks.onBlockPlaced(GRASS, function () {
	
})

```

## Step 4
From the ``||VARIABLES:VARIABLES||`` drawer drag out change item by 1 block and place it in the ``||BLOCKS:on block placed||`` event.

Change the variable to the ``||VARIABLES:b||`` variable created earlier.

This will update the value of b by 1 every time a grass block is placed
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
blocks.onBlockPlaced(GRASS, function () {
    b += 1
})

```

## Step 5
Add an ``||PLAYER:on chat command||`` block and change it to respond to the command **countblocks**
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
blocks.onBlockPlaced(GRASS, function () {
    b += 1
})
player.onChat("countblocks",function () {
	
})
```

## Step 6
Drag a ``||PLAYER:say " "||`` block from the ``||PLAYER:PLAYER||`` drawer and place it in the ``||PLAYER:on chat command "countblocks"||`` block.

Drag a ``||TEXT:join " " " "||`` block from the ``||TEXT:TEXT||`` drawer and drop it on the empty string variable (``||TEXT: " "||``) in the ``||PLAYER:say " "||`` block

Change the text of the first text variable in the join block to "Blocks Used: " and from the ``||VARIABLES:VARIABLES||`` drawer drag out the ``||VARIABLES:b||`` variable and place it in the second part of the ``||TEXT:join "Blocks Used: " " "||`` block

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
blocks.onBlockPlaced(GRASS, function () {
    b += 1
})
player.onChat("countblocks", function () {
    player.say("Blocks Used:" + b)
})

```

## Step 7  @unplugged
To test your code:
1. Return to your Minecraft world and press the **e** key on your keyboard to bring up the inventory window.

3. Equip yourself with the Grass Block and place some Grass Blocks

4. Press the t key on the keyboard to bring up the chat window and type **countblocks** and press  the Enter key.
It should display the number of grass blocks you justplaced.
