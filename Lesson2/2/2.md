# Intermediate Coding - Lesson 2 - Variables
### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
Variables are used in computer programming to store values.

Can you think of a piece of information which is individual for each student in the class?

What about their name or date of birth?

This piece of information could be stored as a variable about each student. 
In Minecraft a variable could be something like a players name, the number of blocks they have, the exact position they are in the Minecraft world or the number of blocks high to build a wall.

## Step 2 @unplugged
Variable Types

There are different types of variables to store different types of values:

- Number variables
- Text variables (sometimes called string variables)
- Boolean variables
- Position variables

## Step 3 @unplugged
Number variables

Number variables can be used to hold a value which is numeric such as:

- The number of blocks a player has
- The age of a person
- The number of lives left in a game

## Step 4 @unplugged
Text variables

Text variables can be used to hold a value which is made up of characters (and numbers) such as:

- A players name
- The name of the world
- The name of your school

## Step 5 @unplugged
Boolean variables

Boolean variables are special variables which can only be one of two values - true (yes) or false (no) - such as:

- Is it raining?
- Is it night time?
- Is the player flying?

## Step 6 @unplugged
Position variables

Position variables are special kinds of variables which hold 3 numbers which define a specific location in the Minecraft world using an X, Y, Z coordinate system. 

This type of variable could be used to specify a position in the world to teleport the player to.

## Step 7 @unplugged
The coordinate system in Minecraft uses X, Y and Z coordinates.

- X is left and right
- Y is up and down
- Z is forward and backwards

Return to the game and move onto the next non player character
